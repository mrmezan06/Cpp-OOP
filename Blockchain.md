### Q 5. Name the two types of records that are present in the blockchain database?

Ans: These records are block records and transactional records. Both these records can easily be accessed, and the best thing is, it is possible to integrate them with each other without following the complex algorithms.

### Q 6. Blockchain is a distributed database. How does it differ from traditional databases?

Ans:
|Properties|Blockchain|Traditional Database|
|---|---|---|
|Operations|Only Insert Operations|Can perform C.R.U.D. operations|
|Replication|Full Replication of block on every peer|Master Slave or Multi-Master |
|Consensus|Majority of peers agree on the outcome of transactions| Distributed Transactions (2 phase commit)|
|Invariants|Anybody can validate transactions across the network|Integrity Constraints|

### Q 7. What are the properties of Blockchain?

Ans: <b>There are four key features of blockchain:</b>

- Decentralized Systems
- Distributed ledger
- Safer & Secure Ecosystem
- Minting

### Q 8. What is encryption? What is its role in Blockchain?

Ans: Data security always matters. Encryption is basically an approach that helps organizations to keep their data secure.
![alt](./img/cryptography-top-blockchain-interview-questions-edureka.png)
The encrypted data is encoded or changed up to some extent before it is sent out of a network by the sender and only authorized parties can access that information.In Blockchain, this approach is useful because it simply adds more to the overall security and authenticity of blocks and helps to keep them secure.

### Q 9. What do you mean by blocks in blockchain technology?

Ans: Blockchain consists of a list of records. Such records are stored in blocks. These blocks are in turn linked with other blocks and hence constitute a chain called Blockchain.

### Q 10. How does a block is recognized in the Blockchain approach?

Ans: Every block in this online ledger basically consists of a hash pointer which acts as a link to the block which is prior to it, transaction data and in fact a stamp of time.

### Q. Explain a real-life use-case where Blockchain is being used?

Ans: Blockchain in Stock Market

Problems in Present Stock Market:

- Centralized and expensive
  - ![alt](./img/centralized-stock-top-blockchain-interview-edureka.png)
  - Depositories and transfer agents are a single point of failure
  - Registration, transfer, distribution, scrutineering, courier fees
  - The more widely held, the higher the administration costs
- Limited Transparency
  - Information asymmetry leads to market advantages
  - Forged securities still a concern
  - Counterparty risk is systemic
- How Blockchain solves the problem

The centralized hub can be removed and the blockchain can be used to directly transfer share ownership between investors.

### Q. What are the key principles in Blockchain that are helpful in eliminating the security threats that needs to be followed?

Ans: Yes, there are a few principles that need to be followed with respect to time. They are:

1. Auditing
2. Securing applications
3. Securing testing and similar approaches
4. Database security
5. Continuity planning
6. Digital workforce training

All these principles are basic and are easy to implement. They are helpful in making the transactions records useful.

### Q. Is the Blockchain Different from Banking Ledgers?

Banks and accounting systems use ledgers to track and timestamp transactions. The difference is that the blockchain is completely decentralized and an open source. This means that people do not have to rely on or trust the central bank to keep track of the transactions. The peer-to-peer blockchain technology can keep track of all the transactions without the fear of having them erased or lost.

Furthermore, the blockchain, because of its open-source nature, is more versatile and programmable than central banking ledgers. If programmers need new functionality on the blockchain, they can simply innovate on top of already existing software through consensus. This is difficult for central banks because of all of their regulations and central points of failure.
